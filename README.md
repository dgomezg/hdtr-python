# hdtr-python

This a python script (WIP) which renders an HDTR image from a set of pictures of the same place taken at different times (usually at intervals as if they were shot to render a timelapse). 

The aim of the project is to render an unique image in which the light flow is visible.

The HDTR concept is coined by Martin Krzywinski and is described at http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/ who also has [a script in Perl to render the image](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/?code)

There is also an implementation of a [Script in Javascript that runs in Photoshop which renders a layered image](https://github.com/dgomezg/hdtr-photoshop-js)

The aim of this project is to provide an open source alternative in python that render not a final blended image but, instead, a layered tiff image.

## Sample files

The repository includes some sets of low-res pictures that can be used to test the script.
