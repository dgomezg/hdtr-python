# hdtr-python

This a python script (WIP) which renders an HDTR image from a set of pictures of the same place taken at different times (usually at intervals as if they were shot to render a timelapse). 

The aim of the project is to render an unique image in which the light flow is visible.

The HDTR concept is coined by Martin Krzywinski and is described at [http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/] who also has a script in Perl to render the image [http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/?code]

There is also an implementation of a Script in Javascript that runs in Photoshop which renders a layered image [https://github.com/dgomezg/hdtr-photoshop-js]

The aim of this project is to provide an open source alternative in python that render not a final blended image but, instead, a layered tiff image.
